# Meetly - Real-time Video Calling App

<br>

Meetly is a real-time video calling web application that enables users to connect with others via meeting rooms that are uniquely generated. Essentially, it uses **WebRTC** technology as it's backbone for peer-to-peer communication which means that you will get low latency video and audio streaming directly from your browsers.

The project is developed by using Node.js, Express, Socket.IO, React.js, Tailwind CSS and PeerJS to develop a user-friendly and engaging video chat experience.
